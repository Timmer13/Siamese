# Siamese Neural Network for Brain Tumor Detection

Our project aims to develop a brain tumor detection system using a Siamese Neural Network (SNN) architecture. Brain tumors are a significant health concern, and early detection plays a crucial role in treatment planning and patient outcomes. In the past, most tumor detection in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans often use CNN network including VGG or Resnet. But the problem is that they usually require a very large dataset, and acquiring data is expensive. We proposed to use SNN in the hope that it could achieve better accuracy with fewer training samples.
